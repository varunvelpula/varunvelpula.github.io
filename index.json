[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hi! I am a second year Masters of Science in Robotics student at the University of Pennsylvania. I had previously done my undergraduate studies at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India. There, I had majored in Mechanical Engineering. My areas of interests are in the control systems and application of machine learning like reinforcement learning and computer vision for robots. I have worked on projects in the domains of manipulator, aerial and ground robotics. I am also interested in localization and mapping, controls, motion and path planning and mechanical design.\nDuring my free time, I read books, draw and listen to music. I read a lot of non-fiction books, particularly relating to anthropology, world history and current affairs. I am a massive F1 and endurance racing fan. In my free time, I like to sketch designs of cars, listen to music and watch football (soccer) matches. My favorite genre of music is Indie Rock/Pop and Garage Rock. My favorite artists/bands are The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, and the Killers.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://varunvelpula.github.io/author/venkat-varun-velpula/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/venkat-varun-velpula/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
